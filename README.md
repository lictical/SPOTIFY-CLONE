# SPOTIFY-

I will create the spotify clone using react for fron end and node.js for back end. for this we will use VITE framework with a react template.

1. Setting the environment.
  First open GIT BASH and enter to you projects folder.
  now create a folder for your project with CMD code:
    
    GIT BASH: 
      "
      mkdir REACT-SPOTIFY-CLONE
      "
   
  Proceed to create the vite app with the following BASH COMMAND:
    GIT BASH: "npm create vite@latest front-end -- --template react"
    
  Once it is done enter the following commands:
    GIT BASH: 
      "
      cd front-end
      npm install
      "
